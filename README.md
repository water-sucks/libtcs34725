# CSC615-RGB-Sensor

This is an Group assignment.  

This is a physical class, so I will want to see what you do in action.  Documentation, including short video clips (can use your cell phone) are required as part of the submission.  It might be handy to have a friend record while you execute your program.

You will also need to submit hardware drawings.  These should be neat (can be either electronic or hand drawn, then scanned) of how the hardware is connected to the Raspberry Pi.  This includes which pin (physical and GPIO), positive and negative flow, resisters, etc.  I should be able to rebuild your setup from this diagram and then run your program and get the same results.  Also see https://www.circuit-diagram.org/editor/# if you want to use that (they have a Raspberry Pi template).

## Assignment Description

This project is to get the RGB sensor working and properly detecting colors.

This is a group project.

It should be designed as a library/module that can be easily included in another project

The main program should call the necessary functions and output should be BOTH an R G B Value set (in Hex) and a Color Name (Color can be approximated with a confidence value)

The code should be as concise as possible and well documented.

The writeup should not only contain the normal sections but for the analysis section should include a "Use section" that describes how to use the library.
